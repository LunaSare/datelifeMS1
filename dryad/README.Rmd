line2.1 <- "DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

1. Description of dataset

These data were generated to investigate and showcase the performance of the datelife R package (<https://github.com/phylotastic/datelife>).
We showcased the application of the package with one mock example and two different biological examples.

The first biological example uses datelife on a small sample of bird species.
The second one uses datelife on bird species belonging to the family Fringillidae of 'true finches', following the NCBI taxonomy.
The mock example was created by replacing species names from the small example with letters, and reducing the number of source chronograms.

We evaluated the performance of the package datelife with two analysis: a benchmarking analysis to measure computing time of functions, and a cross validation analysis to test the accuracy and precision of the functions.

2. File List:

File 1 Name: Sanchez-Reyes_etal_2022_table_1.csv    
File 1 Description: CSV (comma separated values) file with node age results from datelife's small example, presented in Table 1 of the manuscript. It contains node names, taxon names defining the nodes, the corresponding node ages (in Million years), and references of source chronograms that were congruified to the chosen tree topology to extract node ages.
