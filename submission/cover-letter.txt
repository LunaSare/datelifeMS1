Dear Systematic Biology editor-in-chief, Isabel Sanmartín

It is with great enthusiasm that we are resubmitting our manuscript entitled, “DateLife: leveraging databases and analytical tools to reveal the dated Tree of Life” for publication in the journal of Systematic Biology, as a Software article.

We carefully addressed all points made by the reviewers and AE, and we think they greatly improved the manuscript.

We experienced a delay in our resubmission due to a dependency to our software that was orphaned (left without any maintainers), that resulted in it being kicked out from the official R software repository (CRAN). This put at risk the status of our own software. DateLife is hosted in other stable resources, but CRAN is the most widely used, so we decided to adopt the orphaned dependency to get it back on CRAN. However, the dependency is written in a language that we are not very familiar with (C), so it took us a while to figure it out. We believe it was worthy, as the DateLife package is now more stable in the official CRAN repository.

We greatly appreciate your time and consideration for our resubmission, and we look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
