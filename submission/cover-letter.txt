Dear Systematic Biology editor-in-chief, Isabel Sanmartín

It is with great enthusiasm that we are resubmitting our manuscript entitled, “DateLife: leveraging databases and analytical tools to reveal the dated Tree of Life” for publication in the journal of Systematic Biology, as a Software article.

We carefully addressed all points made by the reviewers and AE, and we think they greatly improved the figures and the clarity of the manuscript. We reduced the number of figures from 6 to only 4.

We would like to request for support to have one figure published in color, if possible (figure 3). All other figures are ok to be published in grayscale.

We experienced a delay in our resubmission due to new teaching loads at the university, so it took us a while to get back to the reviews of the figures. We think figures are streamlined and easier to understand and we thank you for pointing us out in that direction..

We greatly appreciate your time and consideration for our resubmission, and we look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
