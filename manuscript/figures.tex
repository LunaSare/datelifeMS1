\caption{Input taxon name processing and chronogram database search computation time increases with number of input taxon names. We sampled N bird species names for each input size class, 100 times, and then performed a \texttt{datelife} search using the Taxon Names Resoultion Service (TNRS; light gray), and without using TNRS (dark gray). We also performed a search using the already processed query for comparison (light blue).}

Age data results of a DateLife search of a small sample of 6 bird species within the Passeriformes. Input names were found across 9 chronograms within 6 independent studies (Barker et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-barker2012going}{2012}), Barker et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-barker2015new}{2015}), Burns et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-burns2014phylogenetics}{2014}), Hedges et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hedges2015}{2015}), Hooper and Price (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hooper2017chromosomal}{2017}), Jetz et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Jetz2012}{2012}).) This revealed 28 age data points for the queried species names.

\caption{LTT plots showing results from the cross-validation analyses of trees without branch lengths dated using BLADJ. The dating analysis can only be performed in trees with more than 2 tips, thus excluding chronogram from study 4; its data was still used as calibration for the other source chronograms.}

We could construct a tree with branch lengths for all source chronograms. However, dating with PATHd8 was only successful in three source chronograms shown here.}
