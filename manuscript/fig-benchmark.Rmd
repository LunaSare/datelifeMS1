\captionof{figure}{\textit{DateLife's benchmarking results. Computation time used to process a query and a search across \texttt{datelife}'s chronogram database, relative to number of input taxon names. For each N = \{10, 100, 200, ..., 1 000, ... , 9 000, 10 000\}, we sampled N species names from the class Aves a hundred times, and then performed a datelife search processing the input names with Taxon Names Resolution Service (TNRS; light gray), and without processing names (dark gray). For comparison, we performed a search using an input that had been pre-processed with TNRS (light blue).}}
