\captionof{figure}{Computation time used to process a datelife query and a datelife search across \texttt{datelife}'s chronogram database, relative to number of input taxon names. For each N = {10, 100, 200, ..., 1 000, ... , 9 000, 10 000}, we sampled N species names from the class Aves a hundred times, and then performed a datelife search with input processing, without implementing Taxon Names Resolution Service (TNRS; dark gray), and implementing TNRS (light gray). We also performed a search using a query that had been pre-processed with TNRS, for comparison (light blue).}
