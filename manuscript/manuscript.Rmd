abstract: |
  Time of evolutionary origin is fundamental for understanding biological processes.

  The combination of new analytical techniques, availability of more fossil and molecular
  data, and efforts to improve data sharing practices in biology has resulted in a steady accumulation
  of time of lineage divergence in public and open databases such as TreeBASE, Dryad, and Open Tree
  of Life for a large quantity and diversity of organisms in the last few decades.

  However, getting a tree with branch lengths proportional to time remains difficult for many biologists and the non-academic community, despite its importance for biological research, medicine, education, and science communication.

  Here we present `datelife`, a service implemented via an R package and a web site
  (<http://www.datelife.org/>) for efficient reuse, summary and reanalysis of expert, peer-reviewed, public data on time of lineage divergence.

  Main results:
    1. blah
    2. blah
    3. blah

  Results in a general context:
  All source and summary chronograms can be saved in formats that permit easy reuse and reanalysis. Summary and newly generated trees are potentially useful to evaluate evolutionary hypothesis in different areas of research in biology.
  How well this trees work for this purpose still needs to be tested.

  `datelife` will be useful to increase awereness on the existing variation in expert time of divergence data, and might foster exploration of the effect of alternative divergence time hypothesis on the results of analyses, nurturing a culture of more cautious interpretation of evolutionary results.
