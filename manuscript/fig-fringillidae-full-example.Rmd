These nodes have age data points from 19 different chronograms from 13 different studies (colored circles), which were summarized into 194 data points that were used as secondary calibrations (purple slashes) with the Branch Length Adjuster (BLADJ ) software from Webb et al., (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Webb2008}{2008}).}
