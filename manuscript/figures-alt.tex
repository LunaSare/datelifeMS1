\caption{Computation time of query processing and search across \texttt{datelife}'s chronogram database relative to number of input taxon names. We sampled N names from the class Aves for each cohort 100 times and then performed a search with query processing not using the Taxon Names Resoultion Service (TNRS; dark gray), and using TNRS (light gray). We also performed a search using the already processed query for comparison (light blue).}

\caption{DateLife analysis results for a small sample of A) 6 bird species within the Passeriformes. B) Processed species names were found across 9 chronograms within 6 independent studies (Barker et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-barker2012going}{2012}), Barker et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-barker2015new}{2015}), Burns et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-burns2014phylogenetics}{2014}), Hedges et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hedges2015}{2015}), Hooper and Price (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hooper2017chromosomal}{2017}), Jetz et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Jetz2012}{2012}).) C) This revealed 28 source age data points for the queried species names. Summarized age data is used as secondary calibrations to date a tree topology obtained from OpenTree's synthetic tree, resulting in a summary chronogram of source ages.}

A) Topology of 2,333 tips and 1,305 internal nodes, encompassing bird species within the family Fringillidae following the NCBI taxonomy (black), as well as all other bird species that share the same mrca node in OpenTree's synthetic tree (purple). B) Topology of 289 tips and 253 internal nodes, encompassing bird species within the Fringillidae only, resulting from pruning purple branches from topology A.
