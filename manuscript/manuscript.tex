\abstract{%
Achieving a high-quality reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree with branch lengths proportional to absolute time (chronogram) is a difficult and time-consuming task. But the increased availability of fossil and molecular data, and time-efficient analytical techniques has resulted in many recent publications of large chronograms for a large number and wide diversity of organisms.
Knowledge of the evolutionary time frame of organisms is key for research in the natural sciences. It also represent valuable information for education, science communication, and policy decisions.
When chronograms are shared in public and open databases, this wealth of expertly-curated and peer-reviewed data on evolutionary timeframe is exposed in a programatic and reusable way, as intensive and localized efforts have improved data sharing practices, as well as incentivizited open science in biology.
Here we present DateLife, a service implemented as an R package and an R Shiny website application available at www.datelife.org, that provides functionalities for efficient and easy finding, summary, reuse, and reanalysis of expert, peer-reviewed, public data on time frame of evolution.
The main DateLife workflow constructs a chronogram for any given combination of taxon names by searching a local chronogram database constructed and curated from the Open Tree of Life Phylesystem phylogenetic database, which incorporates phylogenetic data from the TreeBASE database as well.
We implement and test methods for summarizing time data from multiple source chronograms using supertree and congruification algorithms, and using age data extracted from source chronograms as secondary calibration points to add branch lengths proportional to absolute time to a tree topology.
DateLife will be useful to increase awareness of the existing variation in alternative hypothesis of evolutionary time for the same organisms, and can foster exploration of the effect of alternative evolutionary timing hypotheses on the results of downstream analyses, providing a framework for a more informed interpretation of evolutionary results.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Chronograms --phylogenies with branch lengths proportional to time-- provide key data on evolutionary time frame for the study of natural processes in many areas of biological research, such as comparative analysis (Freckleton, Harvey, \& Pagel, 2002; Harvey, Pagel, \& others, 1991), developmental biology (Delsuc et al., 2018; Laubichler \& Maienschein, 2009), conservation biology and ecology (Felsenstein, 1985; Webb, 2000), historical biogeography (Posadas, Crisci, \& Katinas, 2006), and species diversification (Magallon \& Sanderson, 2001; Morlon, 2014).

Building a chronogram is not an easy task.
It requires obtaining and curating data to construct a phylogeny, selecting and placing appropriate calibrations on the phylogeny using independent age data points from the fossil record or other dated events, and inferring the full dated tree;
it also generally requires specialized biological training, taxonomic domain knowledge, and a non-negligible amount of research time, computational resources and funding.

Here we present the DateLife project which has the main goal of capturing age data from published chronograms, and making these data readily accessible to the community for reuse and reanalysis, for research, teaching, and science communication and policy.
DateLife's core software application is available as an R package (Sanchez-Reyes et al., 2022), and as an online Rshiny interactive website at www.datelife.org. It features key elements for scientific reproducibility, such as a versioned, open and fully public source database (McTavish et al., 2015) that stores data in a computer-readable format (Vos et al., 2012); automated and programmatic ways of accessing and downloading the data in a computer-readable format also (Stoltzfus et al., 2013); and methods to summarize and compare the data.

\hypertarget{description}{%
\section{Description}\label{description}}

DateLife's core software application consists of the R package \texttt{datelife}. Its current stable version -- v0.6.6, is available from The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) repository (Sanchez-Reyes et al., 2022), and relies on functionalities from various biological R packages:
ape (Paradis, Claude, \& Strimmer, 2004),
bold (Chamberlain, 2018),
geiger (Pennell et al., 2014),
paleotree (Bapst, 2012),
phyloch (Heibl, 2008),
phylocomr (Ooms \& Chamberlain, 2018),
phytools (Revell, 2012),
rotl (Michonneau, Brown, \& Winter, 2016), and
taxize (Chamberlain, 2018; Chamberlain \& Szöcs, 2013).
Figure \ref{fig:workflow} provides a graphical summary of the three main steps of the DateLife workflow: creating a search query, searching a database, and summarizing results from the search.

\end{minipage}

\hypertarget{creating-a-search-query}{%
\subsection{Creating a search query}\label{creating-a-search-query}}

DateLife starts by processing an input consisting of at least one taxon scientific name. Multiple input names can be provided as a comma separated character string or as tip labels on a tree.
If the input is a tree, it can be provided as a classic newick character string (Archie et al., 1986), or as a \enquote{phylo} R object (Paradis et al., 2004).
The input tree is not required to have branch lengths, and its topology is used in the summary steps described in the next section.

DateLife processes input scientific names using a Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS), which increases the probability of correctly finding the queried taxon names in the chronogram database. TNRS detects, corrects and standardizes name misspellings and typos, variant spellings and authorities, and nomenclatural synonyms to a single taxonomic standard (Boyle et al., 2013). TNRS also allows to correctly choose between homonyms, by considering other taxa provided as input to infer the taxonomic context of the homonym. DateLife implements TNRS using the Open Tree of Life (OpenTree) unified Taxonomy (OTT, Open Tree Of Life et al., 2016; Rees \& Cranston, 2017) as standard, storing taxonomic identification numbers (OTT ids) for further processing and analysis. Other taxonomies currently supported by DateLife are the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomic database (Schoch et al., 2020), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) taxonomic backbone (GBIF Secretariat, 2022), and the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) database (Rees et al., 2017).

Besides binomial species names, DateLife accepts scientific names from any inclusive taxonomic group (e.g., genus, family, tribe), as well as subspecific taxonomic variants (e.g., subspecies, variants, strains). If a taxon name belongs to an inclusive taxonomic group, DateLife has two alternative behaviors defined by the \enquote{get species from taxon} flag. If the flag is active, DateLife retrieves all species names within the taxonomic group from the standard taxonomy of choice, and adds them to the search query. In this case, subspecific variants are excluded.
If the flag is inactive, DateLife excludes any taxon names above the species level from the search query.
Species and subspecific variant names are processed and searched as provided by the user.
The processed taxon names are saved as an R object of a newly defined class, \texttt{datelifeQuery}, that is used in the following steps. This object contains the input names standardized to a taxonomy of choice (OTT by default), the corresponding OTT id numbers, and the topology of an input tree, if one was provided.

\hypertarget{searching-a-chronogram-database}{%
\subsection{Searching a chronogram database}\label{searching-a-chronogram-database}}

At the time of writing of this manuscript (Jun 22, 2022),
DateLife's chronogram database latest version consist of 253 chronograms published in 187 different studies. It is curated from OpenTree's phylogenetic database, the Phylesystem, which constitutes an open source of expert and peer-reviewed phylogenetic knowledge with rich metadata (McTavish et al., 2015), which allows automatic and reproducible assembly of our chronogram database. Datelife's chronogram database is navigable as an R data object within the \texttt{datelife} R package.

A unique feature of the Phylesystem is that any user can add new published, state-of-the-art chronograms any time, through their curator application (\url{https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator}). As chronograms are added to Phylesystem, they can be incorporated into the chronogram database of the \texttt{datelife} package. \texttt{datelife}'s chronogram database is currently manually updated as new chronogram data is added to Phylesystem. The updated database is assigned a new version number, followed by a package release on CRAN.
Users can also implement functions from the \texttt{datelife} R package to trigger an update of the local chronogram database, to incorporate any new chronograms to the user's DateLife analysis before an official database update is released on CRAN.

A DateLife search is implemented by matching processed taxon names provided by the user to tip labels in the chronogram database. Chronograms with at least two matching taxon names on their tip labels are identified and pruned down to preserve only the matched taxa.
These matching pruned chronograms are referred to as source chronograms.
Total distance (in units of millions of years) between taxon pairs within each source chronogram are stored as a patristic distance matrix (Figure \ref{fig:workflow}).
The matrix format speeds up extraction of pairwise taxon ages of any queried taxa, as opposed to searching the ancestor node of a pair of taxa in a \enquote{phylo} object or newick string.
Finally, the patristic matrices are associated to the study citation where the original chronogram was published, and stored as an R object of the newly defined class \texttt{datelifeResult}.

\hypertarget{summarizing-search-results}{%
\subsection{Summarizing search results}\label{summarizing-search-results}}

Summary information is extracted from the \texttt{datelifeResult} object to inform decisions for subsequent steps in the analysis workflow. Basic summary information available to the user is:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The matching pruned chronograms as newick strings or \enquote{phylo} objects.
\item
  The ages of the root of all source chronograms. These ages can correspond to the age of the most recent common ancestor (mrca) of the user's group of interest if the source chronograms have all taxa belonging to the group. If not, the root corresponds to the mrca of a subgroup withing the group of interest.
\item
  Study citations where original chronograms were published.
\item
  A report of input taxon names matches across source chronograms.
\item
  The source chronogram(s) with the most input taxon names.
\item
  Various single summary chronograms resulting from summarizing age data, generated using the methodology described next.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{\textbf{Choosing a topology.--}}
DateLife requires a tree topology to summarize age data upon.
We recommend that users provide as input a tree topology from the literature, or one of their own making. If no topology is provided, DateLife automatically extracts one from the OpenTree synthetic tree, a phylogeny currently encompassing 2.3 million taxa across all life, assembled from 1, 239 published phylogenetic trees and OpenTree's unified Taxonomy, OTT (Open Tree Of Life et al., 2019).
Alternatively, DateLife can combine topologies from source chronograms using a supertree approach (Criscuolo, Berry, Douzery, \& Gascuel, 2006).
To do this, DateLife first identifies the source chronograms that form a grove, roughly, a sufficiently overlapping set of taxa between trees, by implementing definition 2.8 for n-overlap from Ané et al. (2009).
If the source chronograms do not form a grove, the supertree reconstruction will fail.
In rare cases, a group of trees can have multiple groves. By default, DateLife chooses the grove with the most taxa, however, the \enquote{criterion = trees} flag allows the user to choose the grove with the most trees instead.
The result is a single summary (or supertree) topology, that combines topologies from source chronograms in a grove.

\emph{\textbf{Applying secondary calibrations.--}}
Once a topology is chosen, DateLife applies the congruification method (Eastman, Harmon, \& Tank, 2013) that find nodes belonging to the same clade across source chronograms, and then extracts the corresponding node ages from patristic distance matrices stored as a \texttt{datelifeResult} object. Note that by definition, these matrices store total distance (time from tip to tip), assuming that the terminal taxa are coeval and occur at the present. Hence, node ages correspond to half the values stored in the \texttt{datelifeResult} matrices.
A table of congruified node ages that can be used as calibrations for a dating analysis is stored as a \texttt{congruifiedCalibrations} object.

For each congruent node, the pairwise distances that traverse that node are summarized into a single summary matrix using classic summary statistics (i.e., mean, median, minimum and maximum ages), and the Supermatrix Distance Method (SDM; Criscuolo et al., 2006), which deforms patristic distance matrices by minimizing variance and then averaging them.
These single summary taxon pair age matrices are stored as summarized calibrations that can be used as secondary calibrations to date a tree topology - with or without initial branch lengths, using phylogenetic dating methods currently supported within DateLife: BLADJ (Webb, Ackerly, \& Kembel, 2008; Webb \& Donoghue, 2005), MrBayes (Huelsenbeck \& Ronquist, 2001; Ronquist \& Huelsenbeck, 2003), PATHd8 (Britton, Anderson, Jacquet, Lundqvist, \& Bremer, 2007), and treePL (Smith \& O'Meara, 2012).

\emph{\textbf{Dating a tree topology.--}}
By default, DateLife implements the Branch Length Adjuster (BLADJ; Webb et al., 2008; Webb \& Donoghue, 2005) algorithm to obtain a fully dated topology.
BLADJ takes an initial topology and ignores branch length data if present. Next, it fixes ages on nodes with calibration data, and distributes time for nodes with no data evenly between calibrated nodes, minimizing age variance in the resulting chronogram (Webb et al., 2008). This method is useful for ecological analyses (Webb et al., 2008).
When there is conflict between ages of calibrated nodes, ignores node ages that are older than the age of a parent node.
BLADJ requires a root age estimate. If there is no information on the age of the root in the chronogram database, users can provide an estimate from the literature. If none is provided, DateLife will not return a dated topology and will provide a warning message along with suggestions on how the user can provide an age for the root so the dating analysis can be finished.

Alternatively, the user can choose to obtain a fully dated phylogeny
MrBayes (Huelsenbeck \& Ronquist, 2001; Ronquist \& Huelsenbeck, 2003) approach in DateLife uses the calibrations as priors on node ages.

The latter methods can assign dates using a birth-death model (all of them????), they require initial branch lengths and thus require more time and expertise to run, which makes BLADJ the fastest and most practical method to obtain a dated tree.

In the case the user can provide or obtain branch length data along with a tree topology, phylogenetic dating options supported in DateLife that incorporate branch length information from the input topology in combination with the secondary calibrations:
PATHd8 is a non-clock, rate-smoothing method (Britton et al., 2007) to date trees;
treePL (Smith \& O'Meara, 2012), is a semi-parametric, rate-smoothing, penalized likelihood dating method (Sanderson, 2002).

\emph{\textbf{Dating a tree with branch lengths--.}}
Topologies obtained from OpenTree and with the supertree approach described above lack branch length data.
Yet, phylogenetic dating using branch lengths data is the golden standard for phylogenetic dating analyses, but it is costly and requires a lot of human/expert curation.

A fast solution implemented in DateLife is as follows.
To estimate branch lengths proportional to substitution rates for these topologies, DateLife currently implements a simple algorithm. First, it mines the Barcode of Life Data System, BOLD (Ratnasingham \& Hebert, 2007) to obtain genetic markers for the input taxa.
Mined genetic sequences are aligned with MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) (by default) or MAFFT (Katoh, Asimenos, \& Toh, 2009).

The BOLD sequence alignment is then used to obtain initial branch lengths with the accelerated transformation (ACCTRAN) parsimony algorithm, which resolves ambiguous character optimization, by assigning changes along branches of the tree as close to the root as possible (Agnarsson \& Miller, 2008). This results in older nodes (Forest et al., 2005).
Optionally, the likelihood of the tree topology, the alignment and the reconstructed branch lengths given different evolutionary models, is computed using functions from the \texttt{phangorn} package (Schliep, 2011).

Relative branch length information provides key data for phylogenetic dating, especially for nodes without secondary calibrations available. Yet, topologies without branch lengths can also be dated.

\emph{\textbf{Visualizing results.--}}
Finally, users can save all source and summary chronograms in formats that permit reuse and reanalysis (such as newick and the R \enquote{phylo} format), as well as visualize and compare results graphically, or construct their own graphs using DateLife's chronogram plot generation functions available from the R package \texttt{datelifeplot} (Sanchez-Reyes \& O'Meara, 2022).

\hypertarget{benchmark}{%
\section{Benchmark}\label{benchmark}}

\texttt{datelife}'s R package code speed was tested on an Apple iMac
with one 3.4 GHz Intel Core i5 processor.
We registered variation in computing time of query processing and search through the database relative to number of queried taxon names.
Query processing time increases roughly linearly with number of input taxon names, and
increases considerably if Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS) is activated.
Up to ten thousand names can be processed and searched in less than 30 minutes with the most time consuming settings.
Once names have been processed as described in methods, a name search through the chronogram database can be performed in less than a minute, even with a very large number of taxon names (Fig. \ref{fig:runtime_main}).

\includegraphics{../figures/fig_runtime_main.pdf}
\captionof{figure}{\textit{DateLife's benchmarking results.

For comparison, we performed a search using an input that had been pre-processed with TNRS (light blue).}}
\label{fig:runtime_main}

\texttt{datelife}'s code performance was evaluated with a set of unit tests designed and
implemented with the R package testthat (R Core Team, 2018) that were run both locally
with the devtools package (R Core Team, 2018), and on a public server using the continuous integration tool of GitHub actions (\url{https://docs.github.com/en/actions}).
At present, unit tests cover more than 40\% of \texttt{datelife}'s code (\url{https://codecov.io/gh/phylotastic/datelife}).
Unit testing helps identify potential issues as code is updated or, more critically, as services code relies upon may change.

\hypertarget{case-studies}{%
\section{Case studies}\label{case-studies}}

We illustrate the DateLife workflow using a family within the Passeriform birds encompassing the true finches, Fringillidae, as case study. On a small example, we analysed 6 bird species, and results from each step of the workflow are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:figure2}. As a second example, we analysed 289 bird species in the family Fringillidae that are included in the NCBI taxonomy. The resulting summary chronogram is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fringillidages}, and results from previous steps of the workflow are available as Supplementary Figures.

\hypertarget{creating-a-search-query-1}{%
\subsubsection{Creating a search query}\label{creating-a-search-query-1}}

We chose 6 bird species within the Passeriformes. The sample includes
two species of cardinals:
the black-thighed grosbeak -- \emph{Pheucticus tibialis} and
the crimson-collared grosbeak -- \emph{Rhodothraupis celaeno};
three species of buntings:
the yellowhammer -- \emph{Emberiza citrinella},
the pine bunting -- \emph{Emberiza leucocephalos} and
the yellow-throated bunting -- \emph{Emberiza elegans};
and one species of tanager, the vegetarian finch -- \emph{Platyspiza crassirostris}.
Processing of input names found that \emph{Emberiza elegans} is synonym for \emph{Schoeniclus elegans} in the default reference taxonomy (OTT v3.3, June 1, 2021). For a detailed discussion on the state of the synonym, refer to Avibase (Avibase, 2022; Lepage, 2004; Lepage, Vaidya, \& Guralnick, 2014).
Discovering this synonym allowed assigning five age data points for the parent node of \emph{Emberiza elegans}, shown as \emph{Schoeniclus elegans} in figure \ref{fig:figure2}A, which would not have had any data otherwise.

\hypertarget{searching-the-database}{%
\subsubsection{Searching the database}\label{searching-the-database}}

DateLife used the processed input names to search the local chronogram database and found 9 matching chronograms in 6 different studies (Fig. \ref{fig:figure2}B). Three studies matched five input names (Barker, Burns, Klicka, Lanyon, \& Lovette, 2015; Hedges, Marin, Suleski, Paymer, \& Kumar, 2015; Jetz, Thomas, Joy, Hartmann, \& Mooers, 2012), one study matched four input names (Hooper \& Price, 2017) and two studies matched two input names (Barker, Burns, Klicka, Lanyon, \& Lovette, 2013; Burns et al., 2014). No studies matched all input names. Together, source chronograms provide 28 unique age data points, covering all nodes on our chosen tree topology to date (Table \ref{tbl:table1}).

DateLife obtained OpenTree's synthetic tree topology for these taxa (Fig. \ref{fig:figure2}C), and congruified and mapped age data to nodes in this chosen topology (Table \ref{tbl:table1}).
The name processing step allowed including five data points for node \enquote{n4} (parent of \emph{Schoeniclus elegans}; Fig. \ref{fig:figure2}A) that would not have had any data otherwise due to name mismatch.
Age summary statistics per node were calculated (Table \ref{tbl:table2}) and used as calibrations to date the tree topology using the BLADJ algorithm.
As expected, more inclusive nodes (e.g., node \enquote{n1}) have more variance in age data than less inclusive nodes (e.g., node \enquote{n5}).
Summary age data for node \enquote{n2} were excluded as final calibration because they are older than age data of the more inclusive node, \enquote{n1} (Fig. \ref{fig:figure2}C4).

\hypertarget{creating-a-query}{%
\subsubsection{Creating a query}\label{creating-a-query}}

To obtain ages for all species within the family of true finches, Fringillidae, we ran a DateLife query using the \enquote{get species from taxon} flag,
which gets all recognized species names within a named group from a taxonomy of choice.
Following the NCBI taxonomy, our DateLife query has 289 Fringillidae species names.
This taxon-constrained approach implies that the full DateLife analysis will be performed using a tree topology and ages available for species names from a given taxonomic group, which do not necessarily correspond to a monophyletic group. Users can change this behaviour by providing all species names corresponding to a monophyletic group as input for a DateLife search, or a monophyletic tree to construct a DateLife summary.

\hypertarget{searching-the-database-1}{%
\subsubsection{Searching the database}\label{searching-the-database-1}}

Next, we used the processed species names in our DateLife query to identify chronograms with at least two Fringillidae species as tip taxa.
The DateLife search identified 19 chronograms matching this criteria, published in 13 different studies (Barker et al., 2013, 2015; Burns et al., 2014; Claramunt \& Cracraft, 2015; Gibb et al., 2015; Hedges et al., 2015; Hooper \& Price, 2017; Jetz et al., 2012; Kimball et al., 2019; Oliveros et al., 2019; Price et al., 2014; Roquet, Lavergne, \& Thuiller, 2014; Uyeda, Pennell, Miller, Maia, \& McClain, 2017).
Once identified, DateLife pruned these matching chronograms to remove tips that do not belong to the queried taxon names, and transformed these pruned chronograms to pairwise distance matrices, revealing 1, 206 different age data points available for species within the Fringillidae (Supplementray Table S1).

\hypertarget{summarizing-search-results-2}{%
\subsubsection{Summarizing search results}\label{summarizing-search-results-2}}

The final step entailed congruifying and summarizing the age data available for the Fringillidae species into two single summary chronograms, using two different types of summary ages, median and SDM.
As explained in the \enquote{Description} section, a tree topology to summarize age data upon is required.
By default, DateLife uses the topology from OpenTree's synthetic tree that contains all taxa from the search query.
According to OpenTree's synthetic tree, species belonging to the family Fringillidae do not form a monophyletic group (Fig. \ref{fig:fringillidae-topologies}). Hence, a topology containing only the 289 species from the original query was extracted from Open Tree of Life's synthetic tree v12.3 (Open Tree Of Life et al., 2019).

Age data from source chronograms was congruified to OpenTree's topology (Fig. \ref{fig:fringillidae-topologies}B), reducing the age data set to 818 different data points (Supplementray Table S2). For each congruent node, age summary statistics were calculated and used as fixed secondary calibrations over the chosen tree topology, to obtain a fully dated phylogeny with the program BLADJ (Fig. \ref{fig:fringillidages}).

We performed a cross validation analysis of the DateLife workflow using the Fringillidae chronograms.
We used the individual tree topologies from each of the 19 source chronograms from 13 studies as inputs, treating their node ages as unknown.
We then estimated dates for these topologies using the node ages from the chronograms from the other studies as calibrations and smoothing using BLADJ.
We found that node ages from original study, and ages estimated using all other age data available are correlated (Fig. \ref{fig:cvXY}).
For five studies, Datelife tended to underestimate ages for topologically deeper nodes (those with many descendant taxa, aka \enquote{closer to the root}) relative to the original estimate, and overestimate ages for nodes closer to the tips.
Accordingly, root ages are generally older in the original study than estimated using cross-validated ages (Supplementary Fig. S1).

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

DateLife makes state-of-the-art data on evolutionary time frame easily accessible for comparison, reuse, and reanalysis, to researchers in all areas of science and with all levels of expertise in the matter. It is an open service that does not require any expert biological knowledge from users --besides the names of the species or group they want to work with, for any of its functionality.

A total of 99,474 unique terminal taxa are represented in DateLife's database.
Incorporation of more chronograms into the database will continue to improve DateLife's services. One option to increase the number of chronograms in the DateLife database is the Dryad data repository. Methods to automatically mine chronograms from Dryad could be designed and implemented. However, Dryad's metadata system has no information to automatically detect branch length units, and those would still need to be determined manually by a human curator.
We would like to emphasize on the importance of sharing chronogram data, including systematically curated metadata, into open repositories, such as OpenTree's Phylesystem (McTavish et al., 2015) for the benefit of the scientific community as a whole.

While it is known that incorporating at least some data on lineage divergence times represents a relevant improvement for testing alternative hypothesis using phylogenetic distance in ecological and conservation biology studies (Webb et al., 2008). Next, we discuss some particularities of using summarized node age data from a DateLife analysis that users should be aware of.

\hypertarget{age-variation-in-source-chronograms}{%
\subsection{Age variation in source chronograms}\label{age-variation-in-source-chronograms}}

Conflict in estimated ages among alternative studies is common in the literature. See, for example, the robust ongoing debate about crown group age of angiosperms (Barba-Montoya, Reis, Schneider, Donoghue, \& Yang, 2018; Magallón, Gómez-Acevedo, Sánchez-Reyes, \& Hernández-Hernández, 2015; Ramshaw et al., 1972; Sanderson \& Doyle, 2001; Sauquet, Ramírez-Barahona, \& Magallón, 2021).
Source chronograms available for the same organisms have potentially been estimated implementing calibrations very differently.
For example, the chronograms from Burns et al. (2014) were inferred using molecular substitution rate estimates across birds (Weir \& Schluter, 2008), and have much older age estimates for the same nodes than chronograms that were inferred using fossils as calibrations (Figs. \ref{fig:fringillidages}, \ref{fig:cvXY}; Supplementary Figs. S1, S5).

Different calibration implementations might also imply fundamentally distinct evolutionary hypotheses (Antonelli et al., 2017).
For example, two independent researchers working on the same clade should both carefully select and justify their choices of fossil calibration placement.
Yet, if one researcher concludes that a fossil should calibrate the ingroup of a clade, while another researcher concludes that the same fossil should calibrate the outgroup of the clade, the resulting age estimates will differ, as the placement of calibrations as stem or crown group has been proven to significantly affect time of lineage divergence estimates (Sauquet, 2013).

\hypertarget{primary-vs-secondary-calibrations}{%
\subsubsection{Primary vs Secondary calibrations}\label{primary-vs-secondary-calibrations}}

While most chronograms in DateLife's database are constructed using primary calibrations (molecular substitution rates or ages obtained from the fossil record or geological events), DateLife summarizes chronograms using secondary calibrations (ages coming from other chronograms).
Graur and Martin (2004) cautioned on the increased error and uncertainty in estimated ages when using secondary calibrations in dating analyses.
Schenk (2016) showed that, in simulations, divergence times inferred using secondary calibrations are significantly younger than those inferred with primary calibrations, when obtained with Bayesian inference methods, and when priors are implemented in similar ways in both analyses.
Accordingly, the scientific community seems to have more confidence in chronograms obtained from a single analysis, using fossil data as primary sources of calibrations (Schenk, 2016), and using fossils that have been widely discussed and curated as calibrations to date other trees, making sure that all data reflect a coherent evolutionary history (Sauquet, 2013), as for example done by Antonelli et al. (2017).
There have been attempts to create fossil calibration databases (Ksepka et al., 2015), though these still have room to grow.

It seems that using several (as opposed to just a few) secondary calibrations can provide sufficient information to alleviate or even neutralize potential biases (Sauquet, 2013).
Certainly, further studies are required to fully understand the effect of secondary calibrations on outputs from different tree dating methods, and on downstream analyses. It is possible that secondary calibrations can be safely used with dating methods that do not require setting priors, such as penalized likelihood (Sanderson, 2003), with methods that do not make any assumptions on the ages and fix them to a node on a tree topology, such as BLADJ (Webb et al., 2008; Webb \& Donoghue, 2005), or methods that summarize age data unto a tree topology.

Our cross validation analysis might provide some insight in this regard. When ages are estimated with secondary calibrations, nodes closer to the root do tend to be slightly younger than ages estimated with primary calibrations. However, nodes closer to the tip tend to be older when estimated using secondary calibrations with a dating method that does not make any prior assumptions on the nature of the calibrations themselves (Supplementary Figures S2-S20). The only exception to this was observed on cross validation results of the Burns et al. (2014) chronogram, which displays much younger node ages when estimated using secondary calibrations (Supplementary Figs. S1, S5).

\hypertarget{sumarizing-chronograms}{%
\subsection{Sumarizing chronograms}\label{sumarizing-chronograms}}

By default, DateLife currently summarizes all source chronograms that overlap with at least two species names. Users can exclude source chronograms if they have reasons to do so.
Strictly speaking, a good chronogram should reflect the real time of lineage divergence accurately and precisely.
To our knowledge, there are no tested measures to determine independently when a chronogram is better than another. Yet, several characteristics of the data used for dating analyses, as well as from the output chronogram itself, could be used to score the quality of source chronograms.

Some measures that have been proposed are the proportion of lineage sampling and the number of calibrations used (Magallón, 2010; Magallón et al., 2015).
Some characteristics that are often cited in published studies as a measure of improved age estimates as compared to previously published estimates are: quality of alignment (missing data, GC content), lineage sampling (strategy and proportion), phylogenetic and dating inference method, number of fossils used as calibrations, support for nodes and ages, and magnitude of confidence intervals.

DateLife provides an opportunity to capture concordance and conflict among date estimates, which can also be used as a metric for chronogram reliability.
Its open database of chronograms allows other researchers to do such analyses themselves reproducibly, and without needing permission. Though, of course, they should follow proper citation practices, especially for the source chronogram studies.

The exercise of summarizing age data from across multiple studies provides the opportunity to work with a chronogram that reflects a unified evolutionary history for a lineage, by putting together evidence from different hypotheses.
The largest, and taxonomically broadest chronogram currently available from OpenTree was constructed summarizing age data from 2,274 published chronograms using NCBI's taxonomic tree as backbone (Hedges et al., 2015).
A summarizing exercise may also amplify the effect of uncertainty and errors in source data, and blur parts of the evolutionary history of a lineage that might only be reflected in source chronograms and lost on the summary chronogram (Sauquet et al., 2021).

\hypertarget{effects-of-phylogenetic-sampling-on-downstream-analyses}{%
\subsection{Effects of phylogenetic sampling on downstream analyses}\label{effects-of-phylogenetic-sampling-on-downstream-analyses}}

Analysis of species diversification using simulated and empirical phylogenies suggest that using a more completely sampled phylogeny provides estimates that are closer to the true diversification history than when analysing incompletely sampled phylogenies (Chang, Rabosky, \& Alfaro, 2020; Cusimano, Stadler, \& Renner, 2012; Sun et al., 2020).
Ideally phylogenies should be completed using genetic data, but this is a very hard task to achieve for many biological groups.
Hence, DateLife's workflow features different ways of assigning node ages in the absence of calibrations and branch length information for certain taxa.
Completing a phylogeny using a stochastic birth-death politomy resolver and a backbone taxonomy is a common practice in scientific publications: Jetz et al. (2012), created a chronogram of all 9, 993 bird species, where 67\% had molecular data and the rest was simulated; Rabosky et al. (2018) created a chronogram of 31, 536 ray-finned fishes, of which only 37\% had molecular data; Smith and Brown (2018) constructed a chronogram of 353, 185 seed plants where only 23\% had molecular data. These stochastically resolved chronograms provide less biased diversification rates estimated with methods that account for sampling fractions (Chang et al., 2020; Cusimano et al., 2012), but can also introduce spurious patterns of early bursts of diversification (Cusimano \& Renner, 2010; Sun et al., 2020).

Taxonomy based politomy resolvers also introduce topological differences.
The study of macroevolutionary processes largely depends on an understanding of the timing of species diversification events, and different phylogenetic and chronogram hypothesis can provide very different overviews of the macroeovlutionary history of a biological group.
For example, alternative topologies in chronograms from the same biological group can infer very different species diversification patterns (Rabosky, 2015; Title \& Rabosky, 2016).
Similarly there are worries that patterns of morphological evolution cannot be accurately inferred with these types of phylogenies, as any patterns would be erased by randomization (Rabosky, 2015). We note that the same applies for geographical and morphological dependent diversification analysis. Hence, we suggest that these types of randomly resolved phylogenies can be used as null or neutral models, representing the case of diversification independent of traits and geographical scenario.

While stochastic politomy resolvers have been useful to advance research, notably, risks come with this practice.
Taken to the extreme, one could generate a fully resolved, calibrated tree of all modern and extinct taxa using a single taxonomy, a single calibration, and assigning branch lengths following a birth-death diversification model. Clearly, this can lead to a misrepresentation of the true evolutionary history.
We urge DateLife users to follow the example of the large tree papers cited above, by carefully considering the statistical assumptions being made, potential biases, and assessing the consistency of the results with prior work.

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

Knowledge of the evolutionary time frame of organisms is key to many research areas: trait evolution, species diversification, biogeography, macroecology and more. It is also crucial for education, science communication and policy, but generating chronograms is difficult, especially for those who want to use phylogenies but who are not systematists, or do not have the time to acquire and develop the necessary knowledge and skills to construct them on their own. Importantly, years of primarily publicly funded research have resulted in vast amounts of chronograms that are already available on scientific publications, but hidden to the public and scientific community for reuse.

The DateLife project allows for easy and fast summary of public and state-of-the-art data on time of lineage divergence.
It provides a straightforward way to get an informed idea on the state of knowledge of the time frame of evolution of different regions of the tree of life, and allows identifying regions that require more research, or that have conflicting information.
It is available as an R package, and as a web-based R shiny application at www.datelife.org
Both summary and newly generated trees are useful to evaluate evolutionary hypotheses in different areas of research. The DateLife project should improve awareness of the existing variation in expert time of divergence data, and foster exploration of the effect of alternative divergence time hypothesis on the results of analyses, nurturing a culture of more cautious interpretation of evolutionary results.
