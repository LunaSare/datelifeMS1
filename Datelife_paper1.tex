Supersmart is an open tool but not easy to use, still requires a lot of curation and knowledge.

Time of lineage divergence
constitutes in many ways the fundamental/main knowledge necessary for evolutionary
understanding.
Coupled to species number and distribution, it is the main information necessary
for the study of diversification processes (i.e., the tempo and mode of speciation
and extinction),
central for the understanding of how biodiversity
patterns are shaped across space, time and clades (Morlon \protect\hyperlink{ref-Morlon2014}{2014}).
Evolutionary understanding also relies on comparative studies, for which knowing
the time context for all life is crucial. Efforts to have a whole tree of life have
been great and here are some examples.
In the past two decades, the possibility to obtain good quality DNA sequences
coupled to methodological developments in phylogenetic and dating inference, allowed
the application of molecular dating methods on a very large amount and diversity
of organisms, greatly increasing the quantity of data on taxon
ages across the tree of life.
To date, there is a large amount of both fossil and molecular-based data on taxon
ages and phylogenetic relationships in public repositories such as Dryad, TreeBASE
and Open Tree of Life (OToL).
OToL alone holds more than 200 chronograms.
Methods to include living and fossil lineages are in continued development and increased
usage by the community,
which coupled to better sharing data practices, are greatly contributing to the
accumulation in number and type of available data on taxon ages.

The TimeTree project (Hedges et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hedges2006}{2006}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hedges2015}{2015}; Kumar et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kumar2017}{2017}) has aggregated chronograms
from 3,163 studies, encompassing 97,085 species (Kumar et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kumar2017}{2017}), and continues to grow.
However, even in this gold standard resource, the included taxa only encompass between
0.097 and 3.236\% of total species diversity (following taxonomic expert opinion
on the global, extant species numbers, which ranges from 3 to 100 million species
{[}Mayr2010; Moran2011{]}). One advantage of TimeTree is that it includes taxa from
across the tree of life, versus more specialized chronograms focusing on plants
{[}PHYLOMATIC{]}, birds {[}JETZ ET AL BIRDTREE.ORG{]}, and other groups. Users can choose
between a web interface or a mobile app to receive information on divergence times
for the evolutionary history of a lineage, pairs of taxa, all lineages within a
taxon, or a list of taxa. As a science communication tool, TimeTree project is
very powerful: it has a friendly graphical interface, with informative and colorful
outputs, that allows the general public to satisfy curiosity regarding a particular
organism of interest or group of them. It is of limited utility for scientific
studies, however. The thousands of trees that have been entered are unavailable
for examination or reuse; according to the creators (see TimeTree web FAQ), methods
for allowing data downloading have been under discussion for the past several years
yet the primary data remain closed. Moreover, there is no Application Programming
Interface (API) allowing programmatic access to any data, greatly impairing the
possibility of large-scale, automated data-mining, which is not allowed under TimeTree
website's terms of use. The nearly hundred thousand taxon summary chronogram generated
from TimeTree resources is not available with its publication (Kumar et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kumar2017}{2017}) or the
TimeTree website, though the still substantial chronogram from a previous publication
(Hedges et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hedges2015}{2015}) was made available at OToL.

Despite its great importance, analytical tools to summarize available information
on taxon ages for the scientific community are still lacking.
We identified several aspects that might have so far delayed the exploitation of
existing data. First, original chronograms available publicly are scattered across
various repositories (otol tree store, dryad, treebase, journals supplementary data)
usually with different formats too.
Second, lineage names due to taxonomic idiosincracy can be different among studies
and manual curation of that is usually necessary.
Third, data curation
Recent advances on this area (e.g., supersmart) aim to:
Generate new dates using all available DNA sequence information;
Perform one global analysis using all available information;
Problems or downsides: This might be time consuming for large groups and a lot of
data curation and knowledge on the group of interest is still necessary. For example,
choosing correct fossils for calibration
requires a lot of expertise and knowledge on the group. An incorrect use of fossils
can generate severe bias in dating results (Sauquet et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Sauquet2012c}{2012}).
Hence, data curation is still an important part of any biological study. The research
community considers it as an important or even crucial step before data analysis.
Hence, automated processes for large data analysis are frequently received with skepticism.

DateLife palliates this by only using information available from already published
studies, which are ideally constructed using robust information, such as sequence
data and thoughtfully curated fossil calibrations.

Rapidly increasing data on time of lineage divergence both from molecular and paleontological studies; the increasing importance of use of these data in distant areas of research, often not specialized enough to rapidly obain data on their own; and the lack of an open (both the data sources and the code underlying the analyses) easy to use tool
inspired the development of a prototype \texttt{DateLife} service over a series
of phylotastic hackathons (Stoltzfus et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Stoltzfus2013}{2013}) at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center.
In this paper we present the first formal description of \texttt{DateLife}, featuring an improved database of chronograms, more methods to summarize trees, and new functions to visualize data, as well as comparisons of summary trees.
DateLife is the main service for scaling phylogenetic trees in Phylotastic! system
(Stoltzfus et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Stoltzfus2013}{2013})
It can be used through an R package , a web interface
(\url{http://www.datelife.org/query/}) and an API.

\begin{center}
\textsc{Description}
\end{center}

The basic \texttt{DateLife} workflow is shown in figure \ref{fig:workflow} and consists of:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  A user providing at least two taxon names as input, either as tip labels on a tree, or as a simple comma separated character string. The tree can be in newick or phylo format, and can be with or without branch lengths.
\item
  \texttt{DateLife} then performs a search across its database of peer reviewed and curated chronograms; identifies and gets source trees with at least two matching input names; drops unmatching taxa from positively identified source trees; and finally transforms each source tree to a patristic matrix named by the citation of the original study. This format facilitates and greatly speeds up all further analyses and summarization algorithms.
\item
  The user can obtain different types of summaries from the source data including: a) all source chronograms, b) mrca ages of source chronograms, c) citations of studies where source chronograms were originally published, d) a summary table with all of the above, e) a single summary tree of all source chronograms, and f) a report of succesful matches per input taxon name across source chronograms.
\item
  At this point, users can choose to use all or some source data as calibration points to date a tree of their own making or choosing. 
\item
  Users can also simulate age and/or phylogenetic data of input taxa not found in the database. A variety of algorithms are available for this purpose.
\item
  Finally, users can easily view results graphically as well as construct their own graphs using inbuilt \texttt{DateLife} graphic generators.
\end{enumerate}

\texttt{DateLife}'s chronogram database is currently built from Open Tree of Life (OToL)'s
(Hinchliff et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hinchliff2015}{2015}) tree repository. Among currently existing repositories (e.g., TreeBase,
Dryad), OToL's metadata rich tree store is the only one meeting the requirements
for proper/accurate automatized handling of trees.
Input taxon names accepted by \texttt{DateLife} are binomial species names or clades.
Taxon searches are performed at the species level, so when input names correspond
to higher clades,
\texttt{DateLife} pulls all accepted species names within the
clade from OToL's reference taxonomy to perform the search.
Currently, searches at the infrapsecies level are not allowed, so input names belonging to subspecies or any other infraspecific category are treated
as species.
\texttt{DateLife} also processes input names with the taxon name resolution service (TNRS),
which corrects potentially misspelled names and typos, and standardizes variation
in spelling and synonyms (Boyle et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Boyle2013}{2013}), increasing the probability to correctly find the
queried
taxa in \texttt{DateLife}'s chronogram database.

Source chronogram summary tree can be assembled using the Super Distance Matrix
(SDM) supertree construction approach (Criscuolo et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Criscuolo2006}{2006}) or using the median of branch
lengths and the hierarchical clustering method.
Tree dating and simulation options are performed with various algorithms:
Branch Length Adjuster (BLADJ) is a simple algorithm to distribute ages of undated
nodes evenly, which minimizes age variance in the chronogram (Webb et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Webb2008}{2008}).
PATHd8 is a non-clock, rate-smoothing method (Britton et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Britton2007}{2007}) to date trees.
treePL, is a semi-parametric, rate-smoothing, penalized likelihood dating method
(Smith and O'Meara \protect\hyperlink{ref-Smith2012}{2012}).
MrBayes (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist \protect\hyperlink{ref-Huelsenbeck2001}{2001}; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck \protect\hyperlink{ref-Ronquist2003}{2003}) can be used when adding taxa at
random, following a reference taxonomy or a topological constraint. It draws ages
from a pure birth model, as implemented by Jetz and collaborators (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Jetz2012}{2012}).
To apply calibrations to a tree, th econgruification algorithm described in (Eastman et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Eastman2013}{2013})
is used to find shared nodes between trees (congruent nodes).

To gather, process, and present information, \texttt{DateLife} builds up from functions
available in several R packages including rotl (Michonneau et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Michonneau2016}{2016}), ape (Paradis et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Paradis2004}{2004}),
geiger (Harmon et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Harmon2008}{2008}), paleotree (Bapst \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bapst2012a}{2012}), bold (Chamberlain \protect\hyperlink{ref-Chamberlain2018}{2018}), phytools (Revell \protect\hyperlink{ref-Revell2012}{2012}),
taxize (Chamberlain and SzÃ¶cs \protect\hyperlink{ref-Chamberlain2013}{2013}; Chamberlain \protect\hyperlink{ref-Chamberlain2018}{2018}), phyloch (Heibl), phylocomr (Ooms and Chamberlain \protect\hyperlink{ref-Ooms2018}{2018})
and rphylotastic (O'Meara et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Omeara2019}{2019}).

Details on each step are further developed in \texttt{DateLife}'s R package documentation
\texttt{datelife\ workflow} vignette at (\url{https://LINK}).

\begin{center}
\textsc{Benchmark}
\end{center}

\texttt{DateLife}'s code speed was tested on an Apple iMac
with one 3.4 GHz Intel Core i5 processor.
We registered variation in computing time relative to number of input names
and \texttt{DateLife} service.
Input processing increases roughly linearly with number of input taxon names, and
increases considerably if tnrs service is activated (Fig. \ref{fig:runtime1}).
Results show that searching time increases linearly with number of input names and
number of chronograms in database.

\texttt{DateLife}'s code performance was evaluated with a set of unit tests designed and
implemented with the R package testthat (R Core Team \protect\hyperlink{ref-RCoreTeam2018}{2018}). These tests were run both
locally --using the devtools package (R Core Team \protect\hyperlink{ref-RCoreTeam2018}{2018})-- and on a public server --via
GitHub-- using the continuous integration tool Travis CI (\textless{}//travis-ci.org\textgreater{}). At
present, unit tests cover more than 50\% (for now) of \texttt{DateLife}'s code (\url{https://codecov.io/gh/phylotastic/datelife}).

\begin{center}
\textsc{Example}
\end{center}

In this section we demonstrate the types of outputs that can be obtained with \texttt{datelife}, using the bird family Fringillidae of true finches as example. We performed a higher-taxon search to obtain all data on lineage divergence available from \texttt{datelife}'s database for all recognised species within the Fringillidae (475 spp. according to the Open Tree of Life taxonomy). We found 13 trees across 9 studies (Fig. \ref{fig:schronograms}.

\begin{center}
\textsc{Conclusions}
\end{center}

Taxon ages are key to many areas of evolutionary studies: trait evolution, species
diversification, biogeography, macroecology and more. Obtaining these ages is difficult,
especially for those who want to use phylogenies but who are not systematists, or
do not have the time to develop the necessary knowledge and data curation skills
to produce new chronograms. Knowledge on taxon ages is also important for non-biological
studies and the non-academic community.
The combination of new analytical techniques, availability of more fossil and molecular
data, and better practices in data sharing has resulted in a steady accumulation
of chronograms in public and open databases such as Dryad, TreeBASE or Open Tree
of Life, for a large quantity and diversity of organisms. However, this information
remains difficult to synthesize for many biologists and the non-academic community.

Here, we have shown that DateLife allows
an easy and fast obtention of all publicly available information on taxon ages,
which can be used to generate new data.
This information can be used to account for the effect of phylogenetic signal in
studies of trait evolution; to explore potential speciation and extinction dynamics
of interest within a clade; to obtain a time frame of biogeographical events; for
science communication and outreach, amongst others.
Compared to similar platforms such as time tree of life
and supermart, it offers several advantages.
It is fast;
source data is completely open;
it requires no expert biological knowledge from users for any of its functionalities;
it allows exploration of alternative taxonomic and phylogenetic schemes;
it allows rapid exploration of the effect of alternative divergence time hypothesis;
it allows rapid synthesis in a number of different formats;
it facilitates reproducibility of analyses;

Improvements, short and long-term:
* fossils as calibrations: Using secondary calibrations can generate biased ages when using bayesian methods, mainly because we don't know what prior to give to secondary calibrations
(Schenk \protect\hyperlink{ref-Schenk2016}{2016}).
* bayesian congruification
* topological congruification

Problems and caveats:
Not many databases, only OToL
Why TreeBase is not very useful for us? Be precise.
Are these chronograms reliable to study evolutionary patterns, such as species diversification?
DateLife can be seen as an open resource to know the current state of knowledge on lineage divergence times.
Whether chronograms obtained using this original data can be used reliably to study complicated patterns of evolution is still uncertain.
If all, la facilidad para obtener hipotesis de tiempo de divergencia nos ayudarÃ¡ a evaluar la capacidad de los cronogramas para estudiar otros fenomenos evolutivos.
Por ahora, no podemos aseverar que estos cronogramas puedan usarse para todo tipo de analisis.
